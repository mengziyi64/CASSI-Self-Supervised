## Overviewer
This repository uses a self-supervised neural networks to solve the reconstruction problem of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which uses a two-dimensional (2D) detector to capture a high-dimensional (usually 3D) data-cube in a compressed manner. This source code provides the reconstruction of 10 synthetic data originally used in [TSA-Net](https://github.com/mengziyi64/TSA-Net) paper. So far this version of code only includes the PnP-DIP for the synthetic data.

Fig. 1 Reconstructed synthetic data (sRGB) by 8 algorithms. We show the reconstructed spectral curves on selected regions to compare the spectral accuracy of different algorithms.
